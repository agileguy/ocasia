## Messaging Preferences

### Telegram Format
**Default list format:** Rich text with emojis and structured formatting.
- Use bullet points with emojis (🌐, 📦, ✅, etc.)
- Use **bold** for headers and key values
- Avoid markdown tables and code blocks for lists
- Format: structured lists that render cleanly in Telegram's native UI

Example:
```
**Your Domains:**

🌐 **domain.com** - active
🌐 **example.org** - active
```

No silent execution - you get real-time updates on my actions.
